\section{Introduction}\subsection*{bla}
\frameit{What is Time Series Analysis}{
\item In Module 9.2, you learned about the classical linear regression model (\er{CLRM}).
\item It is used to estimate linear relationships of the form
\[
Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_{i}+U_i\tag{\dag}\label{csr},
\]
possibly with more than one regressor.
\item Typically, 5 assumption are made about the error term: zero mean, constant variance (homoskedasticity), lack of autocorrelation, no correlation with the regressors (orthogonality), normality.
\item These are often justifiable for \er{cross-sectional} data, where each observation $i$ corresponds to a different entity (e.g., a firm, a country, etc.).
}
\frameit{What is Time Series Analysis}{
\item In many areas of financial econometrics (risk models, asset pricing, ...), one deals with \er{time series data} instead; here, every observation corresponds to a different \er{time period}. Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item the price of IBM stock on each trading day since Jan 2nd, 2004;
\item monthly inflation in the EUR area since Jan 2002;
\item US GDP growth in every quarter since 1986Q1, etc.
\end{itemize}
\item As seen above, time series may have different \er{frequencies} (daily, monthly, quarterly, etc.).
\item We will only cover \er{regular} time series: observations occur at equally spaced time points (e.g., daily closing prices for stocks).
}
\frameit{What is Time Series Analysis}{
\item To highlight the fact that we are dealing with time series, we use a subscript $t$ instead of $i$; thus, a regression model such as \ref{csr} would be written
\[
Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1x_{t}+U_t\tag{\ddag}\label{tsr}
\]
if $\{Y_t\}$ and $\{x_t\}$ are time series.

\item Regression \ref{tsr} is unlikely to satisfy the CLRM assumtions; time series usually exhibit \er{autocorrelation}, and often changes in standard deviation (or in ``volatility'', for stock returns).
\item Time series analysis is the study of methods to deal with these salient features.
\item The broader goal (as usual in econometrics) is to empirically \er{verify} economic theories (e.g., the CAPM).
\item Another important aspect is \er{forecasting} (e.g, GDP forecasts, inflation forecasts, Value at Risk forecasts, etc.)
}
\frameit{What is Time Series Analysis}{
\item For most of the course, we will consider \er{univariate} time series analysis.
\item This means that instead of a regression like
\[
Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1x_{t}+U_t
\]
above, we only have \er{one} time series $\{Y_t\}$.
\item The goal is to describe the (dynamic) behavior of $Y_t$, e.g., for forecasting.
\item We'll start with a purely \er{descriptive} approach today. Starting next week, we'll move on to actual dynamic models.

\section{Descriptive TSA}
\frameit{Time Series Plots}{
\item The above plots were all examples of \er{time series plots}: plotting the data against time itself.
\item This is usually the first thing to do when looking at a new data set.
\item We'll see later how to make these plots.
}
\frameit{Decomposing a Time Series}{
\item The main tool of descriptive time series analysis it to decompose it into a \er{trend}, a \er{seasonal} component, and a \er{residual} component, according to the additive model
\[Y_t=F_t+S_t+U_t,\]
where the trend component $F_t$ models long-term movements, the seasonal component $S_t$ measures systematic seasonal patterns, and the residual component $U_t$ contains anything that cannot be explained by the other two\footnote{Sometimes economic time series also contain a cyclical component stemming from the business cycle, but we will ignore this here.}.
\item The Mauna Loa data make the trend and seasonal component very obvious.
}
\section{Trend Estimates}\subsection{OLS}
\frameit{Estimating a Linear Trend by OLS}{
\item One way to estimate a \er{linear trend} is to just regress the data on an intercept and time itself, i.e.,

\[
Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 t + U_t.
\]
\item The estimated trend is then
\[
\widehat{F_t} = \widehat{\beta_0}+\widehat{\beta_1} t.
\]
}
\frameit{Estimating a Quadratic Trend by OLS}{
\item As seen in the exercises, it is also possible to have a nonlinear trend. One example is a \er{quadratic} trend. This can be estimated via the regression

\[
Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 t +\beta_2t^2+ U_t.
\]
\item The estimated trend is then
\[
\widehat{F_t} = \widehat{\beta_0}+\widehat{\beta_1} t+\widehat{\beta_2} t^2.
\]
}
\frameit{Estimating an Exponential Trend by OLS}{
\item Another possibility is to use an \er{exponential} trend. The model is then
\[
F_t = \beta_0\cdot\beta_1^t.
\]
\item To estimate this by OLS, one takes logs:
\[
\log(F_t) = \log(\beta_0)+\log(\beta_1)\cdot t=:c+b\cdot t.
\]
\item Adding an error term, this exponential trend can be estimated via the regression
\[
\log(Y_t) = c+b\cdot t+U_t.
\]
\item The resulting trend function is
\[
F_t = \widehat{\beta_0}\cdot\widehat{\beta_1}^t, \quad\mbox{where } \widehat\beta_0=\exp(\hat{c}),\widehat\beta_1=\exp(\hat{b}).
\]
}
\frameit{Interpreting an Exponential Trend}{
\item If the trend is
\[
F_t = \beta_0\cdot\beta_1^t,
\]
then
\[
\frac{F_t}{F_{t-1}}=\frac{\beta_0\cdot\beta_1^t}{\beta_0\cdot\beta_1^{t-1}}=\beta_1;
\]
i.e., $Y_t$ grows by $100\cdot (\beta_1-1)$\% per period, on average.
\item Example $(\beta_0=1, \beta_1=1.05)$:
\[
F_t = 1.05^t,
\]
so $Y_t$ grows by 5\% a year, on average (cf. compounding interest).
}
\subsection{Moving Averages}
\frameit{Estimating the Trend via Moving Averages}{
\item Another approach, which has the advantage of adapting to the data automatically, rather than pre-specifying a functional form (linear, quadratic, exponential), is to estimate the trend via a \er{moving average.}
\item E.g., for a third-order moving average ($k=3$),
\[
\widehat{F_t}=(Y_{t-1}+Y_{t}+Y_{t+1})/3.
\]
\item Choice of $k$: the higher, the smoother. If seasonality is present, $k$ should cover at least a full cycle.
\item \er{Downside}: $(k+1)/2$ values at the end points cannot be computed. Thus also not useful for forecasting.
\item Note: for a moving average of even order, one averages $k+1$ data points, but the endpoints get half the weight. E.g., with $k=4$,
\[
\widehat{F_t}=\left(\frac{1}{2}Y_{t-2}+Y_{t-1}+Y_{t}+Y_{t+1}+\frac{1}{2}Y_{t+2}\right)/4.
\]
}

\section{Seasonality}\subsection*{bla}
\frameit{Dummy Variables}{
\item Simple way to address the seasonality $S_t$: \er{seasonal dummies}, which take the value one in one season, and zero in all others.
\item Example (see next page): say we have quarterly data. Then we would use four dummies, defined, for $j\in\{1,\ldots, 4\}$, as
\[d_{jt}=\begin{cases}1\mbox{, if observation $t$ is in season $j$,}\\0\mbox{, otherwise.} \end{cases}\]
\item Effectively, every season gets its own intercept.
\item Careful: if a full set of dummies is included, then the intercept must be left off, otherwise the regressors are perfectly collinear; this is the \er{dummy variable trap}.
\item Alternatively, keep the intercept, but remove one of the dummies. That season then becomes the baseline, and the other dummies measure the average difference from the baseline, per season.

}
\frameit{Example continued}{
\item If we include a linear trend, then the model becomes
\begin{align*}
Y_t&=F_t+S_t+U_t\\
&=\beta_1\cdot t+\alpha_1d_{1,t}+\alpha_2d_{2,t}+\alpha_3d_{3,t}+\alpha_4d_{4,t}+U_t,
\end{align*}
which can be estimated by OLS.
\item If we want to produce a forecast for $Y_6$, which is in Season 2, then
\[
\widehat{Y_6}=\widehat{\beta_1}\cdot 6 + \widehat{\alpha_2}.
\]
}
\frameit{Example continued}{
\item Alternatively, include an intercept and drop one dummy:
\[
Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1\cdot t+\alpha_1d_{1,t}+\alpha_2d_{2,t}+\alpha_3d_{3,t}+U_t.
\]
\item This makes Season 4 our baseline; the other seasons are measured in deviation from this baseline.
\item The forecast for an observation in Season 4 is thus simply
\[
\widehat{Y_4}=\widehat{\beta_0}+\widehat{\beta_1}\cdot 4
\]
\item The other seasons are measured in deviation from the baseline; e.g., $\alpha_2$ is the average difference between Seasons 4 and 2:
\[
\widehat{Y_6}=\widehat{\beta_0}+\widehat{\beta_1}\cdot 6+\widehat{\alpha_2}.
\]

}
%\section{EWMA}\subsection*{bla}
%\frameit{Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages}{
%\item The problem that moving average cannot be computed at the boundaries, and hence not used for forecasting, can in principle be solved by using backward-looking, instead of centered, moving averages.
%\item Another problem remains though: the so-called \er{ghosting} problem. A data point (say an outlier) remains in the trend estimate for exactly $k$ periods, then suddenly drops out.
%\item Also, there is a \er{trade-off} in choosing $k$: larger values result in a smoother trend, but also make the trend react more slowly to changes.
%\item Solution: the \er{exponentially weighted moving average}, or \er{EWMA}.
%\item Idea: use \er{all} the data, but give more weight to recent observations.
%\item \er{Prerequisite}: trend and seasonality don't exist, or have been removed.
