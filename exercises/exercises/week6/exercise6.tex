\begin{enumerate}

\item
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the data in the file \texttt{sp500.csv} and construct the log returns (in percent). Use a \texttt{rolling} object with a window of $m=250$ days to compute and plot the historical 1\% VaR.
\item Determine the Normal VaR for the entire sample, both using Python and manually. Also compute (and plot) the normal VaR with the mean and volatility estimated from a rolling window of length $m=250$.
\item Determine the VaR based on a GARCH(1, 1) model with normal innovations.
\item Same, but with standardized $t$ innovations. 
\item Predict the VaR (manually and using Python) for 10/28/2022 based on the GARCH model with $t$ innovations.
\item Make a plot with your VaR estimates overlaid on the negative log returns.
\item Test your VaR forecasts for correct unconditional coverage, independence, and correct conditional coverage.
